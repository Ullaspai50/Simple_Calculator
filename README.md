# Simple_Calculator

This is a sample git project to know and work on the basics of git features

Here I have built a simple calculator in C programming language
Where for the first few versions I have added some basic operations like 

- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division

Expect some more future updates (;
